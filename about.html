<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi! I'm Charles. I'm a student at the University of Waterloo studying 
	Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. 
	I'm very excited for the future that cheaper compute power and 
	advanced Computer Vision will bring, especially with regards to 
	Autonomous Vehicles. </p>

<p> I am the Team Captain of WATonomous, a team of 80 students from the University 
	of Waterloo building a fully electric level-4 self-driving car for the SAE 
	Autodrive Competition. As Team Captain, I direct the team's technical direction and 
	lead our Software division.
	I've worked on all aspects of the autonomous software stack, including a Model 
	Predictive Control (MPC) feedback controller, a Kalman object tracker, 
	a PointPillars 3d LIDAR object detector, and a software-in-the-loop simulation stack
	using CARLA. 
</p>

<p> I've also worked pretty extensively on networking during my internships. At Apple, I worked in the 
	WiFi Peer-to-Peer team which develops the low-latency Wi-Fi features 
	required for AirDrop, AirPlay, AppleTV, and Home Theatre.
	At Cisco, I worked on the Layer 3 packet routing components in the ASR9000, one of Cisco's main edge 
	network routers. 
	I believe that in autonomous vehicles, low-latency networking and inter-vehicle communication
	will be critical for assisting computer vision algorithms and achieving true level 4 self-driving

<h2>Cool courses i've taken that I recommend</h2>

<ul class="skill-list">
	<li>CS484 (Computer Vision): Great introduction to classical computer vision primarily focusing on camera geometry (projections, transforms, epipolar lines). Very important to know classic CV for CV with ML </li>
	<li>ECE495 (Autonomous Vehicles): Holistic overview of all aspects of autonomous vehicles with a surprising level of detail. Taught by an amazing professor (Professor Krzysztof Czarnecki) who leads UW's Autonomoose and WISE lab</li>
	<li>CS246E (Advanced Object Oriented Software Development): Very in-depth exploration of C++ and it's motivations. Essential if you ever want to be good at C++</li>
	<li>STAT240 (Advanced Probability): Hardest course i've ever taken. In-depth exploration of probability and stochastic processes. Definitely worth the effort</li>
	<li>MATH145 (Advanced Algebra): I took this course with Professor David Jao. Amazing introduction to proofs, modular arithmetic, and group theory</li>
</ul>
