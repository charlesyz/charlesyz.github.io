# Charles's Personal Site

Built with Jekyll using based on [Willian Justen's template](https://github.com/willianjusten/will-jekyll-template)

## Getting Started

To work on the site, use **docker-compose**. Simply run `docker-compose up` and the jekyll site will be served at `localhost:3000` with automated refresh.

Before working on the site, remember to change `url` in `config.yaml` to `localhost:3000`
